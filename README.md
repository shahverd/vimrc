# vimrc
This is my VIM/NeoVIM configuration file. Currently I try to keep it as light as possible. To install it and **override** your own configurations run:

    :source https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shahverd/vimrc/main/init.vim | UpdateConfigs
    
And then als each time you can update the configs by:

    :UpdateConfigs

*Remember* that these configurations depend on `curl` to automatically install everything.
